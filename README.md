# Project-3

The third and final project for EECS 581 - Software Engineering 2

## Development Guide

For the issue that you are working on, you should create a branch off of `dev` with the name "I-\#", where 'I' stands for "Issue" and '\#' should be the issue number. For example, if you are working on issue #5, then your branch should be named "I-5".

Note that all work should be done in branches of the `dev` branch. The `main` branch should ideally not be pushed to during normal development, and should only be modified when sprints are finished and `dev` is to be merged.

## Startup Instructions

The startup instructions for the frontend and backend can be found in their respective READMEs:

- [Frontend Startup](frontend/README.md#startup-instructions)
- [Backend Startup](backend/README.md#startup-instructions)
